# Museum Data in MET: A Data Analysis about Collection Diversities 1900 to 2020

This repository contains the code and data used in a data analysis paper about the collection diversities of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) over the years. The paper focuses on the change of nationality, culture, and medium of the artwork collections.

This repository can be found at https://github.com/JunweiZhang130/Museums_Data.git.

## Notes of Reproduction
Because of the size of the MET dataset is over the file limit, therefore the original input dataset is not uploaded in this repository, you can find the dataset at MET openaccess https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess.git.

The paper and the graphs are based on our cleaned data(outputs/cleaned_data.csv), so if you prefer not to review the raw data, that's not a problem. Then run the *references.bib* file (outputs/paper) for references and citations, after that run the *Museum Data in MET: A Data Analysis about Collection Diversities 1900 to 2020* (outputs/paper). 

The repository is organised as follows:                  
## Inputs                
We removed the raw data since the file was too large, but you can find the cleaned_data.csv in the folder.             

## Outputs                   
The outputs folder coontains data file, paper file.

##### Data File                     
Since the restriction of github file size, we included the cleaned dataset cleaned_data.csv. This file includes all data we used in this paper.              

##### Paper File              
The .bib file contains the citations for the raw data, packages and literature used in the report.           
The rmd file contains the research report, as well as the code used to create the report. This code was mainly used to create tables and graphs.               
The pdf file contains the same analysis report but in pdf form, and without the code. 

## Scripts            
The Script folder contains data cleaning process, simulation and a test for all cleaned data.
